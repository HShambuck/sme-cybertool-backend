System Summary (AI + Quantum Integrated Cybersecurity Tool) - backend

This system is an AI-powered cybersecurity assessment and monitoring tool designed for SMEs in sectors like healthcare, energy, and agriculture. It automatically scans systems, IoT devices, and websites to detect vulnerabilities, predict attacks, and generate risk scores with actionable recommendations. AI models analyze behavior patterns, system logs, and network data to identify threats early and guide SMEs toward stronger security practices even without technical expertise.

The system is also Quantum-Ready, meaning it is built to integrate with emerging quantum technologies. In the future, quantum algorithms (such as Grover’s Search) will enable ultra-fast threat detection by rapidly scanning massive datasets for hidden attack patterns. Post-quantum cryptography will protect SME communications from future quantum-powered attacks, and quantum optimization will help businesses prioritize security investments more efficiently.

Overall, the tool delivers smart, automated security today, while preparing SMEs for the next era of cybersecurity shaped by quantum computing.
